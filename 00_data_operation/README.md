# Data Operation

In this chapter, we will use tensorflow to create tensors, vectors and matrices, and perform basic operations, 
including matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, indexing and slicing. We will also learn how to read data sets 
and process pre-processed data sets, culminating in gradient derivations and probability calculations.
