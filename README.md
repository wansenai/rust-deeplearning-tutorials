## Introduction

This tutorial is inspired by two books, Deep Learning and Hands on Learning, and is written in Rust language, combining 
TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. Its goal is to be written for friends who are interested in the Rust language and are 
interested in deep learning. This tutorial is explained through a combination of documentation and code. If you have 
never been exposed to the development of the Rust language, we suggest that you first learn the basic knowledge of the 
Rust language and master the basic syntax. For friends who have never been exposed to artificial intelligence related 
knowledge, we suggest that you first read two books, "Deep Learning" and "Hands on Learning Deep Learning", in order to 
better grasp some basic mathematical knowledge.
